## How this game works
1. Before we start coding, I will explain to you, how this game works:
2. There are 2 players. They can roll the dice, and get the number according to the dice.
3. They cannot roll together, its start from the first player. The second player will get the turn after the first player hold the button or lost.
4. Player can get the random number when they click roll dice button, many times. The number will increase and displayed in current box
5. The current number is just temporarily. Every time the player get the number 1, the current number will lost. So, donâ€™t forget to hold the number, so that will saved in score.
6. Every time the player choose hold button or get the number 1, it will change the turn, to the next player.
7. If the player success to hold 100 number, the player will win.
